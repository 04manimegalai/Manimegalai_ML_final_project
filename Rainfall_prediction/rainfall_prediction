Rainfall Prediction Project
This project aims to predict whether it will rain or not based on meteorological features like pressure, humidity, temperature, cloud cover, and wind conditions using Random Forest Classification.

Key Outcomes:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using mode and median imputation.

Converted categorical rainfall labels ('yes' → 1, 'no' → 0).

Removed highly correlated features to reduce redundancy.

Resampled data to balance class distribution (downsampling).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized distributions of numerical features.

Identified correlations between meteorological factors.

Explored class imbalance and feature importance.

Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:

Used Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Selected the best model with optimized parameters.

Achieved high cross-validation accuracy.

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: Assessed performance on test data.

Confusion Matrix & Classification Report: Measured precision, recall, and F1-score.

Cross-Validation Scores: Verified model reliability across different data splits.

Prediction on New Data:

Tested the trained model with real-world input values.

Provided a binary classification output: "Rainfall" or "No Rainfall".

Model Deployment:

Saved the trained model using pickle for future use.

Can be used for real-time rainfall prediction in weather forecasting applications.

Final Outcome:
A trained and optimized Random Forest model that can accurately predict rainfall based on historical weather data.
This model can be further integrated into weather forecasting systems, agricultural planning, and disaster management applications

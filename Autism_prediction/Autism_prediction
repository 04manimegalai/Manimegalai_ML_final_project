Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction Using Machine Learning

Shape: 800 rows × 22 columns

Columns:

ID: Unique identifier

A1_Score – A10_Score: Responses to 10 autism screening questions (binary: 0 or 1)

Age: Age of the individual

Gender, Ethnicity, Jaundice, Autism (family history), Country of Residence, Used App Before, Relation: Categorical variables

Result: Numerical score from the autism screening test

Age Description: Age group category

Class/ASD: Target variable (0 = No ASD, 1 = ASD)

Missing Values: No missing values in any column.

Data Types:

Numerical: Age, A1-A10 Scores, Result

Categorical: Gender, Ethnicity, Jaundice, Autism, Country, Used App, Relation

Target Variable: Class/ASD (binary classification)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an individual has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on various demographic and behavioral features.

Dataset:
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, ethnicity, jaundice history, country of residence, test scores, and responses to ASD screening questions.

Approach:
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and inconsistent categorical entries.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Identified and replaced outliers using the IQR method.

Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset.

Feature Engineering:

Dropped redundant columns (e.g., ID, age_desc).

Standardized categorical features.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

Used cross-validation to compare model performance.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy.

Deployment & Prediction:

Saved the trained model and label encoders using Pickle.

Created a function to preprocess and predict ASD using new input data.

Results:
The best model was selected based on cross-validation accuracy.

The model was tested on unseen data, achieving high accuracy in ASD classification.

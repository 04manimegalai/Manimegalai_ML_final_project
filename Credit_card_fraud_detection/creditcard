"Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Models"
The outcome of this project is an analysis of fraud detection in credit card transactions using different machine learning models, specifically Na誰ve Bayes and Logistic Regression, with various preprocessing techniques.


1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
The dataset is highly imbalanced (only 0.17% fraud cases).

Features are scaled (Amount feature) and irrelevant features are dropped (Time, some V features).

Undersampling was performed to balance the dataset.

2. Model Performance Evaluation
The project tested multiple cases with different feature selections and data balancing techniques. The key performance metrics observed include:

Na誰ve Bayes (NB) Results
Without dropping features:

Recall: 84.7%

Precision: 5.9% (High false positives)

F1-score: 10.9%

Accuracy: 97.6%

ROC AUC: 96.3%

After feature selection (dropping some V features):

Recall improved to 87.7%

Precision increased slightly

Accuracy improved to 98.3%

Logistic Regression (LR) Results
On imbalanced full dataset:

Recall: 60.2%

Precision: 81.9%

F1-score: 69.4%

Accuracy: 99.9%

ROC AUC: 97.4%

On undersampled balanced dataset:

Recall: 92.8%

Precision: 98.9%

F1-score: 95.7%

Accuracy: 99%

3. Key Insights
Na誰ve Bayes performed well in recall but had low precision, meaning it detected fraud well but had many false alarms.

Logistic Regression was more stable, especially with undersampled data, achieving a good balance between precision and recall.

Undersampling improved recall significantly but may not generalize well to real-world fraud detection.

4. Conclusion
Logistic Regression with undersampling provided the best trade-off between recall and precision.

Na誰ve Bayes is useful for high recall cases but requires further tuning.

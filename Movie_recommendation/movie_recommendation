Movie & TV Show Clustering and Recommendation System
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Merged datasets from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO to create a unified dataset.

Cleaned categorical variables (genres, production countries) and handled missing values.

One-hot encoded categorical variables for better machine learning performance.

2. Clustering with DBSCAN
Used DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to group movies and TV shows based on their features.

Found the best hyperparameters (eps and min_samples) using Silhouette Score Optimization.

Assigned a cluster label to each movie/TV show based on its characteristics.

3. Movie Recommendation System
Implemented a content-based recommendation system using clustering.

When a user inputs a movie name, the system:

Finds the cluster it belongs to.

Suggests similar movies from the same cluster.

If there are more than 5 similar movies, it randomly selects 5 recommendations.

4. Final Results
Users can input a movie name, and the system recommends similar movies based on clustering.

Helps users discover content across different platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO).

DBSCAN ensures that highly similar movies are grouped together while filtering out noise.

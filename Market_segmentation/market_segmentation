"Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering"

Dataset Summary:
Rows: 30,000

Columns: 40

Key Features:

gradyear: Graduation year (integer)

gender: Gender of the individual (M/F or NaN for missing values)

age: Age of the individual (float)

friends: Number of friends (integer)

Various binary features (0 or 1) representing interests, activities, and behaviors (e.g., basketball, football, music, shopping, drunk, drugs)

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment individuals based on their interests and demographic characteristics. The key outcomes are:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values in the gender and age columns.

Scaled numerical features for better clustering performance.

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender) into numerical values.

Optimal Cluster Selection

Used the Elbow Method with KneeLocator to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Identified the best K value for meaningful segmentation.

Cluster Formation & Analysis

Applied K-Means clustering to group individuals with similar interests and demographics.

Visualized cluster distributions and analyzed key differences between groups.



Conclusion
The project successfully grouped individuals into meaningful clusters based on their age, gender, and interests.

"Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning Classifiers"
This project is focused on recommending the best crop to grow based on various environmental factors using machine learning.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset Crop_recommendation.csv is loaded and explored using pandas.

Missing values are checked, and the distribution of the target variable (crop type) is examined.

A dictionary (crop_dict) is used to map crop names to numeric labels, which are then added to the dataset.

Feature and Target Separation:

The features (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, and rainfall) are separated from the target variable (crop_num), which is the numeric label of the crop.

Data Splitting and Scaling:

The data is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

The features are scaled using MinMaxScaler to normalize the values.

Model Training:

Several classification models are trained, including:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Bagging Classifier

AdaBoost

Gradient Boosting

Extra Trees

The accuracy of each model is evaluated, and confusion matrices are displayed.

Model Selection:

The model with the highest accuracy is selected as the best model for crop recommendation.

Crop Recommendation Function:

A function (recommendation) is created to predict the best crop based on new input values (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, temperature, etc.).

The function uses the best model to predict the crop and decode the result back into the crop name using the inverse of crop_dict.

Example Prediction:

A set of new environmental conditions is used to predict the best crop to cultivate.
The result is output, showing the predicted crop.

This project showcases how machine learning models can be applied to predict the optimal crop to grow based on environmental conditions

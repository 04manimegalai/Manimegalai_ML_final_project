Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Analysis & Prediction
Objective:
This project aims to analyze and predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG - miles per gallon) using clustering techniques and machine learning models.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing & Exploration:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset (cluster_mpg.csv).

Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.

Clustering Analysis (Unsupervised Learning):

Used Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to group vehicles based on features.

Visualized relationships with dendrograms, clustermaps, and heatmaps.

MPG Prediction (Supervised Learning):

Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict MPG based on vehicle attributes.

Evaluated model performance using MSE & RÂ² Score.

Prediction for New Vehicles:

Provided a framework to predict MPG for a new vehicle based on given specifications.

Outcomes:
Identified vehicle clusters with similar fuel efficiency patterns.
Developed a highly accurate model to predict MPG.
Provided a data-driven approach for vehicle performance analysis.


Conclusion
Hierarchical clustering effectively grouped vehicles based on key attributes.
Random Forest model accurately predicted MPG, making it a reliable tool for fuel efficiency estimation.
Feature scaling and data preprocessing significantly improved model performance.

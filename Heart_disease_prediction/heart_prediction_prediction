Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient data.

Steps Taken:
Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset and examined its structure.

Checked for missing values (none were found).

Analyzed feature correlations using a heatmap.

Standardized numerical features for better model performance.

Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

Used Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

Model Evaluation & Selection

Compared models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and AUC-ROC curve.

Identified the best-performing model based on test accuracy and AUC score.

The selected model was used for predictions.

Prediction System

Implemented a function to predict heart disease risk for new patient data.

Example patient cases were tested, providing results as "At Risk" or "Not at Risk".

Outcome:
The best model achieved high accuracy in predicting heart disease.

The AUC-ROC curve indicated strong classification ability.

A predictive system was built, which can be used for early risk assessment in patients.

This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can assist in heart disease detection, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and medical intervention

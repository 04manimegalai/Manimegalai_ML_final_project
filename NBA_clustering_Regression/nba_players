1. Project Objective
The goal of this project was to:

Analyze NBA player statistics (e.g., points, assists, rebounds)

Cluster players based on their performance, salary, and popularity

Predict future salaries using machine learning models

Provide insights for decision-making (e.g., player recruitment, salary negotiations)

2. Key Steps & Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Loaded and cleaned the NBA-PLAYERS.csv dataset.

Handled missing values using:

Median/Mode imputation for numerical and categorical features.

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for consistent clustering and modeling.

Applied Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables.

Clustering: PCA + K-Means
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving key information.

Determined the optimal number of clusters using:
Elbow Method
Silhouette Score → Optimal cluster count: 2

Cluster Profiling:

Cluster 0:

Low scorers, fewer assists, lower salaries.

Cluster 1:

High scorers, more assists, higher salaries.

Cluster Visualization:

Bar plots comparing player statistics, salaries, and performance metrics across clusters.


Supervised Learning: Salary Prediction with Regression
Model Selection:

Used Random Forest Regressor to predict NBA player salaries.

Model Tuning:

Applied RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 21641360840768.08

R² Score: 0.5988 → Indicates the model explains ~59.88 of salary variance.

Feature Importance:

Key influencing features:

PTS (Points per game)

AST (Assists)

TRB (Total rebounds)


Visualization & Interpretation
Feature Importance:

Highlighted the most influential stats driving player salaries.

Predicted vs. Actual Salaries (Line Plot):

Showed how accurately the model fits the salary data.

Deviations between the predicted and actual lines indicated model errors.



Top salary-driving features:

Points (PTS) and assists (AST) were the strongest predictors of higher salaries.

Popularity metrics (mean views) also played a role.





3.Potential Business Applications
Player Recruitment & Contracts:

Identify undervalued players with strong performance metrics.

Use cluster-based insights to negotiate better salary contracts.

Performance Analysis:

Track player improvements and compare them across seasons.

Salary Forecasting:

Predict potential future salaries based on current performance.


4.Conclusion:
This project successfully applied clustering and regression models to:

Segment NBA players based on performance.

Predict salaries with a reasonably accurate model.

Provide actionable insights for recruitment, salary negotiation, and performance evaluation.

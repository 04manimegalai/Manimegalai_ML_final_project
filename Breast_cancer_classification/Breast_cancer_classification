"Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Models"

1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Dataset: Loaded from breast_cancer.csv.

Initial Analysis: Displayed dataset shape, column information, and basic statistics.

Feature Engineering:

Dropped unnecessary columns (S/N, Year).

Identified categorical and numerical features.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Converted Tumor Size (cm) and Inv-Nodes to numeric values.

Handled missing values by filling with the median.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed categorical and numerical feature distributions.

Examined correlation between features using a heatmap.

Visualized target variable (Diagnosis Result) distribution.

2. Machine Learning Models
The project employs four classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing.

Model Training & Evaluation
Each model was trained and evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion Matrix

Precision-Recall Curve

ROC Curve and AUC Score

Performance Visualization
Confusion Matrices: Displayed for training and testing sets.

Precision-Recall Curves: Showed trade-offs between precision and recall.

ROC Curves: Evaluated model performance in distinguishing between classes.

3. Model Performance Summary
Each model's performance was analyzed in terms of classification accuracy and visualization:

Logistic Regression: Good baseline performance.

Random Forest: Higher accuracy due to ensemble learning.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Performed well with non-linear classification.

Gaussian Naive Bayes: Faster but may struggle with correlated features.

Conclusion
The project successfully implemented multiple ML models for breast cancer classification.

Random Forest and SVC showed better predictive accuracy.
